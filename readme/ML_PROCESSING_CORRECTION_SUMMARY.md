## ML Processing Pipeline Logic Correction Summary

### 🔍 ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The original `ml_processing.py` file had incorrect logic:

-   **Wrong imports**: Importing from `jobs/enrichment/ml_feature_engineering` instead of proper ML directory structure
-   **Wrong workflow**: Using old "Feature Engineering + Training" instead of proper "Data Preparation + Training"

### ✅ CORRECTIONS MADE

#### 1. Fixed Import Structure

**BEFORE:**

```python
from jobs.enrichment.ml_feature_engineering import run_ml_feature_engineering
from model_training import run_ml_training
```

**AFTER:**

```python
from data_preparation import MLDataPreparation
from model_training import run_ml_training
```

#### 2. Corrected Pipeline Stages

**BEFORE:**

-   Stage 1: ML Feature Engineering (using wrong location)
-   Stage 2: ML Model Training

**AFTER:**

-   Stage 1: Data Preparation (includes data cleaning + feature engineering)
-   Stage 2: Model Training (uses prepared data)

#### 3. Updated Function Names and Logic

**BEFORE:**

```python
def run_ml_feature_stage() -> bool:
    # Called wrong function from wrong location
    result = run_ml_feature_engineering(...)
```

**AFTER:**

```python
def run_data_preparation_stage() -> bool:
    # Uses proper ML pipeline structure
    data_prep = MLDataPreparation(spark_session=spark)
    prepared_df = data_prep.run_full_pipeline(input_date, property_type)
```

#### 4. Fixed Stage Names and Arguments

**BEFORE:**

```python
stages_to_run = ["features", "training"]
--feature-only: "Only run ML feature engineering"
--skip-features: "Skip ML feature engineering stage"
```

**AFTER:**

```python
stages_to_run = ["data_preparation", "model_training"]
--feature-only: "Only run data preparation (Gold → Cleaned Data + Features)"
--skip-features: "Skip data preparation stage"
```

#### 5. Updated Documentation

**BEFORE:**

```
Pipeline xử lý Machine Learning riêng biệt
Gold → ML Features → Trained Models
```

**AFTER:**

```
Pipeline xử lý Machine Learning riêng biệt
Gold → Data Preparation → Trained Models

Pipeline có 2 stages chính:
1. Data Preparation: Gold → Cleaned Data + Feature Engineering
2. Model Training: Prepared Data → Trained Models
```

### 🎯 RESULT

Now the ML processing pipeline:

1. ✅ Uses correct directory structure (`data_processing/ml/pipelines/`)
2. ✅ Implements proper 2-stage workflow (Data Preparation → Model Training)
3. ✅ Follows ML best practices with unified data preparation
4. ✅ Maintains compatibility with unified path manager
5. ✅ Has clear separation from ETL pipeline

### 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. Test the corrected pipeline with real data
2. Verify the MLDataPreparation class works correctly
3. Ensure model_training.py integrates properly
4. Update any documentation that references old structure

The ML processing pipeline now correctly follows the intended architecture!
